Instead, it samples a fixed number of parameter settings based on the distributions you specify (e.g. you might specify that one parameter should be sampled uniformly while another is sampled following a Gaussian distribution). The number of parameter settings that are tried is given by `n_iter`. If all parameters are presented as a list, sampling without replacement is performed. If at least one parameter is given as a distribution, sampling with replacement is used. You should use continuous distributions for continuous parameters.

Ensemble learning involves the combination of several models to solve a single prediction problem. It works by generating multiple classifiers/models which learn and make predictions independently. Those predictions are then combined into a single (mega) prediction that should be as good or better than the prediction made by any one classifer. Unlike single decision trees which are likely to suffer from high Variance or high Bias (depending on how they are tuned) Random Forests use averaging to find a natural balance between the two extremes. <br/> \n",
